        <p>People from different parts of the country have stood by the people affected by the devastating floods in
            Sunamganj. Volunteers, humanitarians and wealthy people from all over the country are coming to the district
            town with relief aid. There has been a risk of renting boats to distribute these reliefs in different parts
            of the haor. Boat fares are being sought three to four times more for relief transport. Locals said it was
            important for the administration to monitor and coordinate in this regard.</p>
